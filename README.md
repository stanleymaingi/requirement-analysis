# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the requirement analysis phase in software development. It serves as a learning resource that explores how to gather, analyze, and structure software requirements clearly to ensure successful project outcomes.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. Its main goal is to clearly understand what the software system should do before any design or development begins.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work together to identify functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform, such as security, usability, and performance). These requirements are carefully reviewed to ensure they are complete, clear, feasible, and aligned with business objectives.

Requirement Analysis is important because it helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces development risks, and minimizes costly changes later in the project. By defining clear requirements early, teams can plan effectively, design appropriate solutions, and deliver software that meets user needs and expectations. A well-executed requirement analysis lays a strong foundation for successful software development.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for several reasons:

1. **Prevents Misunderstandings:**  
   By clearly defining what stakeholders need and expect, requirement analysis ensures that the development team builds the right system and reduces the chances of miscommunication.

2. **Reduces Development Risks and Costs:**  
   Identifying requirements early helps detect potential issues before coding begins, minimizing costly changes, rework, and project delays.

3. **Improves Planning and Design:**  
   With a clear understanding of requirements, teams can plan resources, design architecture, and implement solutions that are aligned with business goals, resulting in higher quality software.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The following are the five key activities involved in Requirement Analysis:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collect information from stakeholders, users, and other sources to understand what the system should achieve.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Engage with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observations to uncover implicit and explicit requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Record all gathered and elicited requirements in a clear, structured format, such as SRS (Software Requirements Specification), to ensure shared understanding.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Examine the requirements to identify conflicts, dependencies, and priorities. Use models like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or prototypes to visualize requirements.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Confirm with stakeholders that documented requirements are complete, accurate, and aligned with business objectives before moving to design and development.
